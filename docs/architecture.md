# Project Architecture and Boundaries

This document defines the responsibilities of each module so a fresh clone can be configured and run on any Windows machine without hardcoded local paths.

## Runtime Flow

```text
WPF or CLI
  -> mailbox source selection
  -> ChatGPT email registration
  -> auth session/access token fetch
  -> PayPal/Stripe hosted payment-link generation
  -> session JSON + SQLite index
  -> status display and maintenance actions
```

## Boundary Rules

### WPF UI

`SmsWorkbench/MainWindow.xaml.cs` may:

- Read `config.json`.
- Create temporary mailbox selection files.
- Start `chatgpt_phone_reg.py`.
- Display SQLite/session/mailbox state.
- Open PayPal links in Chrome incognito.

It must not implement ChatGPT registration, PayPal protocol details, mailbox OTP polling, or direct SQLite business rules beyond display and deletion.

### CLI

`sms_tool/cli.py` is the orchestration boundary. It may:

- Parse arguments.
- Load mailbox sources.
- Choose single vs batch registration.
- Persist results through `storage.py`.
- Return meaningful exit codes.

It must not silently replace an explicit empty mailbox file with a new provider purchase. If the user passed a mailbox file and no mailbox was parsed, it exits with code `2`.

### Mailbox Layer

`sms_tool/mailbox.py` owns:

- Chatai file parsing.
- Standard OAuth mailbox file parsing.
- LuckMail purchase/token mailbox handling.
- Microsoft refresh-token exchange.
- OTP polling.
- Email normalization for mailbox inputs.

It must not write registration results or modify mailbox pool files during registration.

### Registration Layer

`sms_tool/registration.py` owns:

- Sentinel token extraction/cache usage.
- ChatGPT auth/signup flow.
- OTP validation.
- Auth session access-token retrieval.
- Batch worker limits.

Batch registration uses each loaded mailbox at most once. If `--count` exceeds loaded unique mailboxes, the batch is capped instead of wrapping with modulo and reusing a mailbox concurrently.

### PayPal Link Layer

`sms_tool/gen_pp_link.py` only generates the hosted Stripe/PayPal redirect URL from an access token. It does not perform PayPal account signup, card entry, SMS verification, or final payment authorization.

`paypal.stage_proxies` can route stages independently:

```json
{
  "checkout": "socks5h://127.0.0.1:7897",
  "stripe_init": "socks5h://127.0.0.1:7897",
  "payment_method": "socks5h://127.0.0.1:7897",
  "confirm": "direct"
}
```

### Storage Layer

`sms_tool/storage.py` owns:

- SQLite schema creation and migrations.
- Case-insensitive account deduplication.
- Email normalization before upsert.
- PayPal status and refresh-token status persistence.
- Rebuilding SQLite from `sessions/session_*.json`.

`accounts.email` is treated as a normalized logical key. Updates should modify an existing row for the same email instead of creating a new row with different casing or a repaired alias spelling.

### Codex OAuth and CPA Layer

`sms_tool/codex_oauth.py` owns only the Codex OAuth authorization-code + PKCE sequence:

- Build the OAuth authorize URL.
- Reuse existing auth cookies when they already produce a callback code.
- Continue username login.
- Complete email OTP only when OpenAI routes the flow to an email OTP page, or when takeover is explicitly enabled.
- Exchange the callback code for OpenAI `access_token`, `id_token`, and `refresh_token`.

It deliberately does not upload to CPA and does not own phone-number inventory.

`sms_tool/codex_sentinel.py` owns auth.openai.com sentinel cookie/header helpers. Cached Cloudflare/auth cookies may be reused, but the cached `oai-did` is stripped before import so one global browser fingerprint is not assigned to every account.

`sms_tool/codex_phone.py` owns add-phone completion. It is disabled by default. If OpenAI requests `/add-phone`, the OAuth layer reports `add_phone_required` unless `codex_oauth.auto_phone_verification` is true.

`sms_tool/codex_export.py` converts session JSON into the compact Codex JSON shape. `sms_tool/cpa_import.py` uploads that JSON to CPA and refuses files without a real `rt_` refresh token or without a real `id_token`.

Important behavior:

- Default CPA import no longer forces `/log-in/password` accounts into passwordless takeover.
- `codex_oauth.allow_passwordless_takeover=true` is an explicit escape hatch for takeover-style OTP login.
- Forced takeover may require add-phone even when a local row is marked payment-completed, so it should not be the normal Plus-account path.

## Portable Configuration

All paths in `config.example.json` are relative by default:

```json
{
  "email_registration": {
    "token_file": "mailbox_tokens.txt"
  },
  "runtime": {
    "directory": "runtime"
  },
  "storage": {
    "sqlite_path": "runtime/accounts.sqlite3"
  },
  "codex_oauth": {
    "allow_passwordless_takeover": false,
    "auto_phone_verification": false
  },
  "output": {
    "directory": "sessions"
  }
}
```

Relative paths are resolved from the repository root via `sms_tool/paths.py` or WPF `rootDir` detection. A user may still use absolute paths in local `config.json`, but committed config templates and docs should not depend on one developer's machine.

## Status and Dedup Semantics

The WPF list may load the same logical account from:

- mailbox pool text file,
- SQLite,
- session JSON fallback.

Rows are deduplicated by normalized email for display. SQLite/session rows have higher priority than mailbox-pool rows because they represent updated registration/payment state.

## Exit Codes

```text
0  command completed normally
2  explicit mailbox source was empty or malformed
3  registration succeeded but PayPal link generation failed
```

## Local Files That Must Stay Out of Git

```text
config.json
sms_tool/config.json
mailbox_tokens.txt
sessions/
runtime/
dist/
.dotnet/
```
